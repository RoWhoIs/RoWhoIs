2. **Objective**: Clearly state the objective of the functionality. What problem does it solve? What is the expected outcome?

3. **Requirements**: List all the requirements that need to be met for the functionality to work correctly. This can include dependencies, APIs, libraries, or any other necessary components.

4. **Design**: Describe the design of the functionality, including any architectural decisions, algorithms, or data structures used. Use diagrams or flowcharts if necessary to illustrate the design.

5. **Usage**: Provide clear instructions on how to use the functionality. Include any necessary configuration settings, input formats, or expected outputs.

6. **Error Handling**: Describe how errors and exceptions should be handled. Specify any error codes, error messages, or logging requirements.

7. **Testing**: Outline the testing strategy for the functionality. Specify the test cases, expected results, and any automated testing frameworks or tools to be used.
