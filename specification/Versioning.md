# RoWhoIs Versioning

## Design

The versioning system is simple.

```
v1.3.4r5
```

Where 1 denotes a full release version, 3 denotes a major version, 4 denotes a minor version, and r5 denotes a revision version.

However, not all RoWhoIs versions follow this exact structure. Anything past a major version denotation is not required, meaning we can have a version as simple as `v1.3`.
